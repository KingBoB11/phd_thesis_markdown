abstract = {Three major purposes for evaluating the hardware and software performance of computer systems--selection evaluation, performance projection, and performance monitoring--are described. Eight techniques that have been used or suggested for evaluating performance are discussed. Each of these techniques is rated on its suitability for the three purposes of evaluation. Recommendations are made on the most appropriate technique for each evaluation purpose. These suggestions include the development of a comprehensive set of synthetic programs on an industry-wide basis for selection evaluation purposes. Simulation is recommended as the most suitable technique for performance projection. Finally, a number of hardware and software monitors are available for performance monitoring.},

abstract="With the emergence of Internet as a world-wide infrastructure for communication and information exchange, Internet-based distributed applications have gained remarkable popularity. One of the most promising approaches for developing such applications is the Java-based mobile-agent paradigm [5,8,15,39]. Mobile Agents (MA) are being used already in a variety of applications ranging from telecommunications management to Web databases, cooperative environments information-gathering systems, electronic commerce systems, intelligent distributed systems, and so on [23,24,7,9,4]. In that context, a distributed application can be considered as a dynamic group of agents working in coordination to accomplish some goal.",
