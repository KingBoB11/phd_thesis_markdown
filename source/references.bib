@book{perfomance_evaluation,
abstract = {Three major purposes for evaluating the hardware and software performance of computer systems--selection evaluation, performance projection, and performance monitoring--are described. Eight techniques that have been used or suggested for evaluating performance are discussed. Each of these techniques is rated on its suitability for the three purposes of evaluation. Recommendations are made on the most appropriate technique for each evaluation purpose. These suggestions include the development of a comprehensive set of synthetic programs on an industry-wide basis for selection evaluation purposes. Simulation is recommended as the most suitable technique for performance projection. Finally, a number of hardware and software monitors are available for performance monitoring.},
